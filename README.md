# Datorkonstruktion
**A course in Computer Architecture and Construction**

**Description**

A computer written in VHDL that can be synthesized to an FPGA(Xilinx Spartan-6) using Digilents Nexys3 board. The computer is able to load a program using the UART-standard. An interesting project dealing with building a computer from scratch and then coding the game snake while having very limited memory.

**File Structure***

util/ has files that has been used in the purpose of debugging.

tmp/ are temporary files.

src/ all files used for synthetization

doc/ documentation

**Compilation and Synthetization**

Look at any Makefile in any directory..
